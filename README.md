# handmotion_models

The repository contains two neural network models that are used to classify hand positions and gestures, based on hand key points from the [handpose model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/handpose).

In the **near future, I will** (I believe that if I bold this text, it will motivate me to do so) publish a library that uses the above models to navigate applications and websites using the hand, via hand detection from a video camera image.
